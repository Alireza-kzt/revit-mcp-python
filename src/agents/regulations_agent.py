Simplified Building Regulations Checklist:
1. Minimum Room Sizes:
   - Bedrooms: At least 7.5 sqm. Master bedroom at least 10 sqm.
   - Living Room: At least 15 sqm.
   - Kitchen: At least 5 sqm.
2. Ceiling Height: Minimum 2.4 meters for habitable rooms. (Assume standard if not specified in design)
3. Natural Light/Ventilation: All habitable rooms (bedrooms, living rooms) should have access to natural light (e.g., windows). (Assume design implies this if not explicitly denied)
4. Safety:
   - Balconies must have railings (assume designed if "balcony" is mentioned).
   - Clear evacuation paths (conceptual: avoid designs that seem to block exits).
5. Accessibility: (Simplified) At least one entrance should be accessible without steps. (May not be checkable from conceptual design).

Based on the design proposal, identify any potential violations of these simplified regulations.
If all clear, state "Design Approved".
If there are issues, state "Design Requires Modification" and list the specific issues and suggestions.
Focus only on these simplified regulations.
